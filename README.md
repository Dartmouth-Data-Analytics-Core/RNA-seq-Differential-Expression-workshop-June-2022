## RNA-seq differential expression workshop, July 2022

This workshop will be delivered on July 18, 20, & 22 (12-5pm each day) by the Data Analytics Core (DAC) of the [Center for Quantitative Biology at Dartmouth](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/).

The DAC aims to facilitate advanced bioinformatic, computational, and statistical analysis of complex genomics data for the Dartmouth research community.

If you have questions about this workshop, or would like to discuss data analysis services available from the Data Analytics Core, please visit our [website](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/projects-and-cores/data-analytics-core/), or email us at: DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu
